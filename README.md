This sample project highlights an issue I'm facing with diffable data sources. The app is simple: there's a table view that shows a list of items, and a bar button item that changes the text of the first visible cell. Changes are made by modifying the underlying model, creating a new snapshot and applying it to the data source. When tapping the button you can choose whether or not using animation.

When you don't animate the update, the cell is updated correctly. However when `animatingDifferences` is `true`, the `cellProvider` block in the data source isn't called. If you scroll the table view (making the cell disappear) and go back, the cell shows the updated value.
